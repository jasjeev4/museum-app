As a customer admiring an artifact, I'd like to be able to hold it so I'm able to see it from a different angle.

As a sight-seer, I'd like to have a unique momento from my trip to the museum to remember it by.

As the owner of the museum, I don't want people handling one of a kind ancient artifacts So nothing gets broken.

As a curator of the museum I'd like to upload new artifacts to the app

As someone who can't physically go to the museum, I'd like to be able to see the artifacts.

As a customer admiring an artifact, I'd like to be able to see it from a different angle.

As someone with an interest in archeology, I'd like to be able to hold an artifact.

As the owner of the museum, I don't want people handling one of a kind ancient artifacts.

As a sight-seer, I'd like to have a unique momento from my trip to the museum.

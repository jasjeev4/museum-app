# museum-app

Trello Scrum Board: https://trello.com/b/vgvNXlEn/museum-app

Project description:
The project is building an app that will run on mobile that will enable visitors of the Kallinikeio Municipal Museum of Athienou to visualize 3d models of the artifacts in the museum in augmented reality. 

Project impact:
The app would supplement a museum visit by allowing visitors to virtually handle these artifacts without disturbing the pieces themselves - giving them a novel way of experiencing history.
